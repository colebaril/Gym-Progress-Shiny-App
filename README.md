# Gym-Progress-App

This is code for a Shiny app to track my gym progress. 

This app displays my exercise weight and frequency progression over time. Also shown is a exercise calendar showing what times of the day and on what days of the week I exercise.

This app was built using R and the tidyverse to compute stats, ggplot2 for data vizualizations and hosted with Shiny. Data was logged and stored using the Strong App. All exercise was done at Snap Fitness Kildonan.
